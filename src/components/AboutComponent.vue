        <p class="paragraph text-shadow"> My career life began when I graduated from Boise State University with a BS in
          criminal
          justice. Shortly
          after graduating I learned that the world of law enforcement was not for me. I found myself working in the
          logistics industry for 5 years, but it was not a fulfilling career path. I discoverd software development
          from
          a simple Udemy course on javascript and after that I knew it was what I wanted to pursue. After a grueling
          13-week software development bootcamp with CodeWorks Boise, I have gained the confidence and skills needed
          to pursue my developer goals.</p>
